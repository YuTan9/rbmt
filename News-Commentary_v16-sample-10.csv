"Alternatively, low interest rates could push her (or her pension fund) to buy risky long-maturity bonds. Given that these bonds are already aggressively priced, such a move might thus set her up for a fall when interest rates eventually rise. ",低利率也可能促使他（或他的退休基金）购买高风险长期债券。 这些债券的定价本来就较为激进，当利率最终开始升高时，买入操作可能会给他带来损失。 事实上，美国很可能正走在失业问题未了、退休危机即来的路上。 
"After the failure of President George W. Bush’s and Senator Edward Kennedy’s comprehensive immigration reform effort last spring, most observers thought the matter would remain dormant until 2009, since even touching it was potentially fatal for Democrats and Republicans alike. But as Democrats discovered in other recent debates, and as Republicans realized with a little help from the CNN organizers, who skewed the questions toward issues they feel strongly about, immigration is an issue that just won’t go away. ",几个星期前共和党总统侯选人辩论中出现的众多惊奇之一就是重新触及了移民的重要性。 去年秋天布什总统和肯尼迪参议员的全面移民改革失败以来，大多数观察家认为这一事情将会在2009年以前搁置起来，因为即使是触及此事也会对民主和共和两党是潜在致命的。 但是正如民主党人在最近的辩论中所发现的以及共和党人在有线电视新闻网组织者帮助下认识到的那样，移民问题是一个挥之不去的问题。 这些电视台组织者拼命对那些他们有强烈感觉的问题提出问题。 
"Our analytical framework can help countries figure out which SDGs benefit others, and which do not. With it, policymakers can prioritize goals and investments; map existing resources and identify budget gaps; and establish mechanisms for sharing data and information across sectors. ",那么，我们可以从这里得到什么？ 我们的分析框架可以帮助各国认清哪些SDG有利于其他目标，哪些则正好相反。 如此，决策者就可以制定重点目标和投资；厘清现有资源并发现预算缺口；以及建立跨部门数据和信息共享机制。 
"SANTIAGO – It was the kind of politics Brazilians thought they had left behind: One day the sitting president appoints a popular former president to her cabinet in order to save him from prosecution, and pundits are quick to conclude that he is in charge. The next day, a federal judge blocks his appointment, claims and counterclaims are filed before the courts, millions take to the streets demanding the president’s impeachment, and no one is quite certain who is in charge. ",圣地亚哥—巴西人认为，巴西政治把他们甩在了身后：有一天，在任总统任命了一位受人欢迎的前总统进入内阁以使他免于被起诉，专家们马上宣布他已经掌控局面。 第二天，联邦法官驳回了他的任命，申诉和反诉纷至沓来，数百万人走上街头要求弹劾总统，没人确定谁掌控了局面。 
"These are trying times for French President François Hollande. Besieged economically at home, where his popularity is at its lowest since his election last year, can he regain credibility, if not support, as supreme commander of French forces? ",这些都是对法国总统奥朗德的试金石。 在国内，奥朗德饱受经济问题困扰，其支持度已降至去年当选以来最低。 在这样的情况下，他能从新赢得作为法军最高指挥官的信誉（姑且不论支持）吗？ 
"It is often observed that, every four years, the US does without a foreign policy. This time, it seems to have gotten an early start. ",人们常常观察到，每隔四年，美国就会迷失于外交政策。 这一回，迷失来的早了一些。 
"But the more interesting question is what all of this means for the eurozone as a whole. The prescient calls from Joseph Stiglitz, Jeffrey Sachs, and many others for a different approach to sovereign debt in general need to be modified to fit the particular characteristics of the eurozone’s crisis. ",但更有趣的问题是所有这些对作为整体的欧元区的意义。 约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stigltiz ） 、 杰弗里·萨克斯（Jeffrey Sachs）和其他许多人颇有先见之明地呼吁改良一个不同的针对一般需要的主权债务的方针，以适应欧元区危机的特殊性质。 
"New tariffs that made imports more costly and that shifted demand toward domestic goods would require offsetting effects in a near-full-employment economy in order to shift demand back to foreign sources. The most plausible such offset was, of course, appreciation of the real exchange rate, which could occur only through inflation or, more plausibly, a stronger dollar. ",我预计，减税和利率正常化将让政策组合向宽财政、紧货币变化，而这一组合在里根-沃尔克时代曾推高美元汇率。 鼓励美国公司汇回海外利润的税制变化将释放一波资本流入，进一步推高美元。 让进口品变得更加昂贵的新关税将促使需求向本国产品倾斜，在接近充分就业的经济状态，这需要抵消效应以使需求重新偏向外国。 当然，最合理的抵消效应便来自真实汇率升值，而这只能通过通货膨胀或（也更合理）强势美元实现。 
"Historically, the US has added disproportionately to the rising concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and among large countries it remains the biggest per capita emitter of carbon dioxide by far – more than twice China’s rate and nearly 2.5 times more than Europe in 2013 (the latest year for which the World Bank has reported complete data). With its high income, the US is in a far better position to adapt to the challenges of climate change than poor countries like India and China, let alone a low-income country in Africa. ",历史上，美国对大气中温室气体浓度的不断提升施加了超出正常比例的影响。 该国目前仍是各个国家中人均二氧化碳排放量最多的国家 — — 2013年（世界银行公布完整数据的最近一年）的排放量分别超过中国和欧洲的2倍和2.5倍以上。 得益于较高的收入水平，美国在适应气候变化挑战方面处于比印度和中国这类低收入国家更好的地位，更别提那些低收入的非洲国家了。 
"Free elections do not determine politicians’ behavior, and do not necessarily ensure that moral, energetic, and intelligent people fill high offices. But freedom and democracy do restrict arbitrariness and theft, and encourage politicians, regardless of their moral qualities, to take public interests into account. ",通过赢得自由公平选举上台的政坛人物们主要对选民负责。 这并不一定让他们仅仅为了公众利益而工作。 即使竞争性选举的胜利者也要对其竞选团队和赞助人抱有承诺。 但是，真正的政治反对派存在创造了一种不同的氛围，这一氛围扩散到选举之外。 自由选举并不决定政坛人物的行为，而且也并不一定确保道德高尚、精力充沛以及聪明的人占据高位。 但是自由和民主的确限制独断和盗窃，并且鼓励政坛人物要考虑公众利益，而无论其道德素质如何。
